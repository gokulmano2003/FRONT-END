            7 WONDERS OF THE WORLD
        </h1>

            The New 7 Wonders of the World was a campaign started in 2001 to choose Wonders of the World from a
            selection of 200 existing monuments.[1] The popularity poll via free Web-based voting and small amounts of
            telephone voting was led by Canadian-Swiss Bernard Weber and organized by the New 7 Wonders Foundation (N7W)
            based in Zurich, Switzerland, with winners announced on 7 July 2007 in Lisbon, at Estádio da
            Luz.[2][3][4][5] The poll was considered unscientific partly because it was possible for people to cast
            multiple votes.[6] According to John Zogby, founder and current President/CEO of the Utica, New York–based
            polling organization Zogby International, New 7 Wonders Foundation drove "the largest poll on record".[4]

            The program drew a wide range of official reactions. Some countries touted their finalist and tried to get
            more votes cast for it, while others downplayed or criticized the contest.[4][6] After supporting the New 7
            Wonders Foundation at the beginning of the campaign by providing advice on nominee selection, the United
            Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), bound by its bylaws to record and give
            equal status to all World Heritage Sites, distanced itself from the undertaking in 2001 and again in
            2007.[7][8]

            The 7 winners were chosen from 21 candidates, which had been whittled down from 77 choices by a panel in
            2006.

            The New 7 Wonders Foundation, established in 2001, relied on private donations and the sale of broadcast
            rights and received no public funding.[9] After the final announcement, New 7 Wonders said it did not earn
            anything from the exercise and barely recovered its investment.[10] Although N7W describes itself as a
            not-for-profit organization, the company behind it—the New Open World Corporation (NOWC)—is a commercial
            business. All licensing and sponsorship money is paid to NOWC.

            The foundation ran two subsequent programs: New 7 Wonders of Nature, the subject of voting until 2011, and
            New7Wonders Cities, which ended in 2014. <button>Read more</button>

            Angkor Wat in Cambodia has been named the 8th Wonder of the World. Angkor Wat is the largest religious
            structure in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The temple was built in the 12th century by King
            Suryavarman II....<button>Read more</button>
            <br>The title of “Eighth Wonder of the World” is also given to other remarkable new buildings, projects, or

            The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ-/; lit. 'Crown of the Palace')[4][5][6] is an ivory-white marble
            mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631
            by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal;
            it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre)
            complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a
            crenellated wall.

            <br>Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of
            the
            project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in
            1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2023 would be approximately ₹35
            billion.[7] The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of
            architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor's court architect. Various types of symbolism have been
            employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity.

            <br> The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art
            in
            India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as
            the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7-8
            million visitors a year,[8] and in 2007 it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World
            (2000–2007) initiative.

        Nippon Gakki Co., Ltd (currently Yamaha Corporation) was founded by <b>Torakusu Yamaha in 1887 to manufacture
            reed
            organs and pianos and became the largest Japanese manufacturer of musical instruments in the early 20th
            Century.</b>
        Yamaha was contracted to manufacture wooden and (later) metal airplane propellers by the Japanese government
        during World War II. The company struggled in the aftermath of the war, and in the early 1950s, chairman Genichi
        Kawakami decided to repurpose its underutilized war-time facilities to manufacture small motorcycles for leisure
        use.[5
    </p>
    <h2>
        <ins> Beginnings: 1955</ins>
    </h2>
    <p>
        The motorcycle division of Yamaha was spun off in 1955, being incorporated on 1 July 1955 in Japan,[6] and was
        headed by Genichi Kawakami. Yamaha's initial product was a 125 cc (7.6 cu in) two-cycle, single cylinder
        motorcycle, the <b>YA-1</b>, which was a copy of the German <b>DKW RT 125. The YA-1 was a competitive success at
            racing
            from the beginning, winning not only the 125cc class in the Mt.</b> Fuji Ascent, but also sweeping the
        podium with
        first, second and third place in the All Japan Autobike Endurance Road Race that same year.[7] Early success in
        racing set the tone for Yamaha, as competition in many varieties of motorcycle racing has been a key endeavor of
        the company throughout its history, often fueled by a strong rivalry with Honda, Suzuki, Kawasaki and other
        Japanese manufacturers.

        Yamaha began competing internationally in 1956 when they entered the Catalina Grand Prix, again with the YA-1,
        at which they placed sixth. The YA-1 was followed by the YA-2 of <b>1957,</b> another 125cc two stroke, but with
        significantly improved frame and suspension.[8] The YD-1 of <b>1957</b> was a 250cc two-stroke twin cylinder
        motorcycle, resembling the <b>YA-2,</b> but with a larger and more powerful motor. A performance version of this
        bike,
        the <b>YDS-1</b> housed the 250cc two-stroke twin in a double downtube cradle frame and offered the first
        five-speed
        transmission in a Japanese motorcycle.[9] This period also saw Yamaha offer its first outboard marine engine.

        Success and growth in the 1960s
        By 1963, Yamaha's dedication to both the two-stroke engine and racing paid off with their first victory in
        international competition, at the Belgian GP, where they won the 250cc class. Success in sales was even more
        impressive, and Yamaha set up the first of its international subsidiaries in this period beginning with Thailand
        in 1964, and the Netherlands in <b>1968. 1965</b> saw the release of a 305cc two-stroke twin, the flagship of
        the
        company's lineup. It featured a separate oil supply which directly injected oil into the gasoline prior to
        combustion (traditionally riders had to pre-mix oil into gasoline together before filling the gas tank on two
        stroke engines). In 1967 a new larger displacement model was added to the range, the 350cc two stroke twin R-1.

        <b>In 1968,</b> Yamaha launched their first four-stroke motorcycle, the<b> XS-1.</b> The Yamaha<b>XS-1</b> was a
        650cc four-stroke
        twin, a larger and more powerful machine that equaled the displacement and performance of the popular British
        bikes of the era, such as the Triumph Bonneville and BSA Gold Star. Yamaha continued on with both the two-stroke
        line and four-stroke twins at a time that other Japanese manufacturers were increasingly moving to four cylinder
        four-stroke machines, a trend led by Honda in<b>1969</b> with the legendary<b> CB750</b> four-stroke
        four-cylinder cycle.

            n January 1955, Nippon Gakki's (Japan Instrument) Hamana Factory in Hamakita was ready to begin production
            of
            the YA-1, and the first bikes were delivered to dealers in February.[8] This new motorcycle had been heavily
            influenced by the contemporary DKW model RT125, and like the DKW was driven by a 125 cc two-stroke, single
            cylinder engine, but the YA-1 designers paid particular attention to materials, assembly, and engineering
            upgrades, such as going from a three-speed to a four-speed transmission. With confidence in the new
            direction
            that Genichi Kawakami was taking, Nippon Gakki founded Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd. on July 1, 1955, and made
            Kawakami
            the new company's first president. Staffed by 275 employees, the new motorcycle manufacturer built about 200
            units per month by the end of 1955.[4][6][9]

            That same year, Yamaha entered its new YA-1 in the two biggest race events in Japan. They were the 3rd Mt.
            Fuji
            Ascent Race held in July 1955, and the 1st Asama Highlands Race in November. In these debut races, Yamaha
            won
            the 125 cc class.[10][11]

        <strong> are <b>multicellular, eukaryotic organisms </b>in the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions,
            animals
            consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are able to move, <i>can reproduce sexually, and
                grow
                from a hollow sphere of cells,</i> the blastula, during embryonic development.

            As of 2022, around 2.16 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1.05 million are
            insects, <em>over 85,000 are molluscs, and around 65,000 are vertebrates. It has been estimated there are as
                many as
                7.77 million animal species on Earth. Animals'</em> body lengths range from 8.5 μm (0.00033 in) to 33.6
            m
            (110 ft).
            They have complex ecologies and interactions with each other and their environments,<mark style="background-color: antiquewhite;">forming intricate
                food
                webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology,</mark> and the study of animal behaviors is
            known
            as
            ethology.

            Most living animal species belong to the infrakingdom Bilateria, a highly proliferative clade whose members
            have
            a bilaterally<ins> symmetric body plan. Extant bilaterians include the basal group Xenacoelomorpha, but the
                vast
                majority belong to two large superphyla: the protostomes, which include phyla such as arthropods,
                molluscs,
                flatworms, annelids and nematodes, etc.; and the deuterostomes, which include the three phyla
                echinoderms,
                hemichordates and chordates, the latter with the vertebrates being its most successful subphylum.
                Precambrian
                life forms interpreted as early complex animals were already present in the Ediacaran biota of the late
                Proterozoic, but fossils of primitive sponge and other speculative early animals</ins> have been dated
            to as
            early as
            the Tonian period. Nearly all modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil record as marine
            species during the Cambrian explosion, which began around 539 million years ago (Mya), and most classes
            during
            the Ordovician radiation 485.4 Mya. 6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified;
            these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 Mya during the Cryogenian period.

            Historically, Aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those without. Carl Linnaeus created the
            first
            hierarchical biological classification for animals in 1758 with his Systema Naturae, which Jean-Baptiste
            Lamarck
            expanded into 14 phyla by 1809. In 1874,<del>Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular
                Metazoa
                (now synonymous with Animalia) and the Protozoa, single-celled organisms no longer considered
                animals.</del>
            In modern
            times, the biological classification of animals relies on advanced techniques, such as molecular
            phylogenetics,
            which are effective at demonstrating the evolutionary relationships between taxa.

            Humans make use of many other animal species for food (including meat, eggs and dairies), for materials
            (such as
            leather, fur and wool), as pets and as working animals for transportation, and services. Dogs, the first
            domesticated animal, have been used in hunting, in security and in warfare, as have horses, pigeons and
            birds of
            prey, while other terrestrial and aquatic animals are hunted for sports, trophies or profits. Non-human
            animals
            are also an important cultural element of human evolution, having appeared in cave arts and totems since the
            earliest times, and are frequently featured in mythology, religion, arts, literature, heraldry, politics and
            sports.

            Nature is an inherent character or constitution,[1] particularly of the ecosphere or the universe as a
            whole. In this general sense nature refers to the laws, elements and phenomena of the physical world,
            including life. Although humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as a whole are often described
            as at times at odds, or outright separate and even superior to nature.[2]

            <br> During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive
            reality, organized and moved by divine laws.[3][4] With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly
            became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention: it was hence considered as sacred
            by some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human
            history (Hegel, Marx). However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the pre-Socratic one, got reborn at
            the same time, especially after Charles Darwin.[2]

            <br>Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and wildlife. Nature can
            refer
            to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with
            inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the
            weather and geology of the Earth. It is often taken to mean the "natural environment" or wilderness—wild
            animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human
            intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human
            interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or
            "the whole of nature". <br>This more traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today
            implies
            a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has
            been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind. Depending on the particular context, the
            term "natural" might also be distinguished from the unnatural or the supernatural.[2]

            <br>Etymology
            The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or
            "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".[5] In ancient
            philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which
            originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals, and other features of the world to
            develop of their own accord.[6][7] The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of
            several expansions of the original notion;[2] it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by
            pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and
            has steadily gained currency ever since.
            The words nature and natural are used for all the things that are normally not made by humans. The word
            comes from the Latin natura meaning "birth". Nature includes many things like weather, organisms, landforms,
            celestial bodies. Scientists study the way the parts of nature work. Things that have been made by people
            are said to be man-made or called artifacts.

            <br> There are natural sciences that study different parts of nature, for example the science of ecology is
            about
            plants and animals as a whole, while biology studies every type of living thing.

            From one point of view, humans are a prime example of nature, and are the most widely studied natural
            inhabitants of the planet earth. Humans interact with each other in their natural environment on a
            day-to-day basis. Every part of nature – everything from the air outside to the dirt on the ground – is
            interdependent. Medicine studies humans in health and sickness.

            From another point of view, humans and nature can be said to be in conflict. People always use natural
            resources. They cut down trees, mine ores, grow crops and manufacture things from natural material. Fires,
            cars, and factories make a lot of smoke and harm many places. People who like to leave nature unharmed and
            those who feel they need to use more of nature often fight about what they should do. In the modern world,
            with many more people and many big cities, these problems are becoming more serious.

            Nature, in the broadest sense, means the physical world as a whole. This is the meaning that physics, the
            study of nature (etymologically), takes.

            A useful definition of natural is

            "Happening or operating in accordance with the ordinary course of nature". Oxford Shorter English Dictionary
            says the word in this sense is first found in 1477.

            "Happening or operating in accordance with the ordinary course of nature". Oxford Shorter English Dictionary
            says the word in this sense is first found in 1477.The origin of life on Earth is not well understood, but
            it is known to have occurred at least 3.5 billion years ago,[62][63][64] during the hadean or archean eons
            on a primordial Earth that had a substantially different environment than is found at present.[65] These
            life forms possessed the basic traits of self-replication and inheritable traits. Once life had appeared,
            the process of evolution by natural selection resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.

            Species that were unable to adapt to the changing environment and competition from other life forms became
            extinct. However, the fossil record retains evidence of many of these older species. Current fossil and DNA
            evidence shows that all existing species can trace a continual ancestry back to the first primitive life
            forms.[65]

            When basic forms of plant life developed the process of photosynthesis the sun's energy could be harvested
            to create conditions which allowed for more complex life forms.[66] The resultant oxygen accumulated in the
            atmosphere and gave rise to the ozone layer. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted
            in the development of yet more complex cells called eukaryotes.[67] Cells within colonies became
            increasingly specialized, resulting in true multicellular organisms. With the ozone layer absorbing harmful
            ultraviolet radiation, life colonized the surface of Earth.
